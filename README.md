# Beer_Pong
## Purpose
	So this is a pong game that you can play against a human opponent with powerups and abilities
	The reason that it is called Beer Pong is that I want to also create a potential drinking game function to the game
	This will add a "Drink" ability  that if you gain the amount (say 5) tokens the person must at least one drink
	At the end of the game
